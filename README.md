**Data Science Projects Repository:**
Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases my journey and experience in various fields of data science, from machine learning and data analysis to web scraping and data visualization. Each project dives deep into solving real-world problems using cutting-edge data science techniques.

. Data Analysis
. Web Scraping
. Real-World Datasets

**Machine Learning**
This section contains projects that involve building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. Each project includes:
. Supervised Learning: Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and more.
. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN.

 **Data Visualization**
These projects focus on creating insightful and interactive visualizations using tools like:
. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For static plots such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.
. Folium: To create geographical maps with interactive features.
. Plotly: For interactive visualizations and dashboards.
. Learn how to turn data into informative visuals that communicate the underlying insights.

**Data Analysis**
In this section, I work with real-world datasets, performing:
. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removing missing data, handling outliers, and transforming data.
. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights from data using statistical methods and visualizations.
. Feature Engineering: Crafting new features to improve model performance.
. Each project demonstrates how to effectively use pandas, NumPy, and scipy for in-depth analysis.

**Web Scraping**
Projects here utilize web scraping techniques to gather data from online sources. Tools and techniques include:
. BeautifulSoup and Scrapy: For extracting data from websites.
. APIs: Interacting with public APIs to collect structured data.
. Automation: Using Selenium for dynamic website scraping.
. Real-World Datasets

In all of the projects, I work with real-world datasets, often from sources like:
. Kaggle: Popular datasets for competitions and research.
. Government/Open Data Portals: Datasets related to economics, health, and more.
. APIs & Scraped Data: Extracted data from web scraping or public APIs.
